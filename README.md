# files_organizer

WARNING !!! 
Do not test it on your important folders and files, it is still in development phase.

A small cross-platform GUI application made using Python. 
It can organize any folder which is cluttered with different types of files (most probably your downloads folder), into their separate respective folders. By default it organizes the target folder in-place but you can even choose to move the organized structure of the new tree somewhere else.
